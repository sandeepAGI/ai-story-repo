Review README and code base to get an understanding of current state
Please review run_dashboard.py to see how the streamlit dashboard has been implemented.
We will make changes pages by page
In the Analytics page - can we remove the stories by year?  I don't think that adds value. Also, the top 15 tech mentioned is impacted by the fact that we have substantially more Microsoft stories.  We should consider maybe showing this by source?
For outcomes - how can we show? Should we think about a word cloud?
Please also share a list of all the catagorical data we have, so we can figure out other charts to share
Do not make any code changes without checking plan with user
