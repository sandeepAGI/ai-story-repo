We are developing an application based on requirements ai-big5-stories.md
TRACKER-LOG.md is used to periodically update with our approach, progress, results of testing, key decisions etc. to make sure that all key decisions are logged and we can reference them from time to time
At this stage, all key functionalities for Phase 2 have been completed
Please do a data trace review to make sure you do not find any errors
After that, please purse the database
And then start a new build, uplaod customer stories from all the source using the utlility that we build
Make sure you allow for timeouts etc.
After we build the database, please do a thorough analysis of missing values
