Review README and code base to get an understanding of current state
Please review run_dashboard.py to see how the streamlit dashboard has been implemented.
Also, review all the git commits to get a good sense of the history of this build
I would like your recommendations to refactor and simplify the code base
For example, we still have a lot of test utilities that can be replaced by one or two regression test that we use as we make any further updates
After we review your recommendations, we will come up with a plan
Be thorough and take your time
