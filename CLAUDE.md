We are developing an application based on requirements ai-big5-stories.md
TRACKER-LOG.md is used to periodically update with our approach, progress, results of testing, key decisions etc. to make sure that all key decisions are logged and we can reference them from time to time
Please review it and keep updating it, as needed.
It is very important that we are throughful, deleberate and do not take shortcuts to minimize the need for rework
When in doubt, ask user - please do not make any assumptions before confirming with user
At any point, if we were to restart - all required documentations should be in the ai-big5-stories and the tracker-log md documents
Now we will do a few things - first create a gitignore file to make sure that no secrets or actual data is replicated in our remote repo 
Create an initial commit and then push to https://github.com/sandeepAGI/ai-story-repo
After that we will continue with our Phase 2 starting with OpenAI
